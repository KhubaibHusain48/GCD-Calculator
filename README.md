# ðŸ§® Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator

This Java program calculates the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two numbers provided by the user using a straightforward iterative approach.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

* Accepts two integers from the user.
* Finds the GCD by checking all numbers up to the smaller of the two inputs.
* Prints the GCD value.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prerequisites

* Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)

### Steps

1. Save the code in a file named `GCD.java`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac GCD.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   java GCD
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Sample Output

```
Enter the first number: 
24
Enter the second number: 
36
GCD of 24 and 36 is 12
```

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

* Looping and iteration
* Modulus operator `%`
* Helper methods (`least` to find the smaller number)
* Conditional logic
